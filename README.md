# WELCOME
###### to the repository for my home page

### This repository is suppose to be written without dependencies in regular HTML, CSS, and JS.
As long as I don't have to run `npm install`, I think I'll be fine.<br/>
Libraries imported through script tags are acceptable, but they're on thin ice.
